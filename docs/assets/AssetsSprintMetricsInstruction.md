### This is an instruction for Assets metrics at end of each sprint:

1. Update **Metrics_BCR**  for Assets team: **Stories Completed** and **SP completed, Bugs/Tech Debt** and **# of releases**: 

    - Stories Completed, SP completed and Bugs/Tech Debt information can be found from burndown chart on ZH board
    - # of releases can be found from release report

2. Update **Modernization Metrics** for **Goal Reached, Escaped Defects** and **Scope changes**: 
    - **Goal Reached**, Team will discuss together on Tuesday's standup and provide a percentage  
    - **Escaped Defects**: Ask team how many PROD issues encountered during this sprint
    - **Scope changes** can be found from Asset ZH board, bottom right corner “Insights”
    
3. Send to Release Train Engineer (James) an email about our team’s demo 
    - Ask who can demo what on previous Friday's standup (most often tightly related with sprint goal)
    - Confirm with presenter on Monday and Tuesday's standup, to make sure the presenter is still ready for demo
